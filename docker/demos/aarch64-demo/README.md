Tell me how the game ends >>> Now colleges from sea to sea 
May sing of colors true, 
But who has better right than we 
To hoist a symbol hue: 
For sailors brave in battle fair 
Since fighting days of old, 
Have proved the sailor’s right to wear 
The Navy Blue & Gold. 
So hoist our colors, hoist them high, 
And vow allegiance true, 
So long as sunset gilds the sky 
Above the ocean blue, 
Unlowered shall those colors be 
Whatever fate they meet, 
So glorious in victory, 
Triumphant in defeat. 
Four years together by the Bay, 
Where Severn joins the tide, 
Then by the Service called away, 
We’re scattered far and wide; 
But still when two or three shall meet, 
And old tales be retold, 
From low to highest in the Fleet, 
We’ll pledge the Blue and Gold.
Hail, Alma Mater dear,
To us be ever near,
Help us thy motto bear
Through all the years.
Let duty be well performed,
Honor be e'er untarned,
Country be ever armed,
West Point, by thee.
Guide us, thy sons, aright,
Teach us by day, by night,
To keep thine honor bright,
For thee to fight.
When we depart from thee,
Serving on land or sea,
May we still loyal be,
West Point, to thee.
And when our work is done,
Our course on earth is run,
May it be said, 'Well Done;
Be Thou At Peace.'
E'er may that line of gray
Increase from day to day,
Live, serve, and die, we pray,
West Point, for thee.
Beat Navy!$
